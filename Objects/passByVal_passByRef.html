<h1>Pass By Value vs Pass by reference</h1>
<script>

    /*
Pass by Value - means when you make a function call, the local parameter in the function just has the value of the passed variable.
                So, if you update the parameter in the function, only the value gets updated within the function and the actual variable is not
                updated (unless you specifically set it).
Pass by Reference - means when you make a function call, the variable's reference is passed.
                    So, if you update the variable in the function, the actual variable also gets updated.



Sum Up -
If it was pure pass by value, then changing obj1.item would have no effect on the obj1 outside of the function.
If it was pure pass by reference, then everything would have changed. num would be 100, and obj2.item would read "changed".
Instead, the situation is that the item passed in is passed by value. But the item that is passed by value is itself a reference.
Technically, this is called call-by-sharing.
In practical terms, this means that if you change the parameter itself (as with num and obj2),
that won't affect the item that was fed into the parameter. But if you change the INTERNALS of the parameter,
that will propagate back up (as with obj1).

    function changeStuff(a,b,c){
        a=a*10;
        b.item="new";//changing the internals of an object -- will reflct back!
        c={item:"new"};
    }
    var num=10;
    var obj1={item:"old"};
    var obj2={item:"old"};

    changeStuff(num,obj1,obj2);
    console.log("num: "+num);
    console.log("obj1: "+obj1.item);// change is reflected!!
    console.log("obj2: "+obj2.item);
